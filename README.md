# ExploratoryDataPlots

This repository contains 4 scripts that create 4 plots. 
Based on the data found in the Household Power Consumption data which is downloaded from here: https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/exdata%2Fdata%2Fhousehold_power_consumption.zip. 

The codebook can be found here:

## Assignment Criteria

Our overall goal here is simply to examine how household energy usage varies over a 2-day period in February, 2007. Your task is to reconstruct the following plots below, all of which were constructed using the base plotting system.

First you will need to fork and clone the following GitHub repository: https://github.com/rdpeng/ExData_Plotting1

For each plot you should

* Construct the plot and save it to a PNG file with a width of 480 pixels and a height of 480 pixels.
* Name each of the plot files as 𝚙𝚕𝚘𝚝𝟷.𝚙𝚗𝚐, 𝚙𝚕𝚘𝚝𝟸.𝚙𝚗𝚐, etc.
* Create a separate R code file (𝚙𝚕𝚘𝚝𝟷.𝚁, 𝚙𝚕𝚘𝚝𝟸.𝚁, etc.) that constructs the corresponding plot, i.e. code in 𝚙𝚕𝚘𝚝𝟷.𝚁 constructs the 𝚙𝚕𝚘𝚝𝟷.𝚙𝚗𝚐 plot. Your code file should include code for reading the data so that the plot can be fully reproduced. You must also include the code that creates the PNG file.
* Add the PNG file and R code file to the top-level folder of your git repository (no need for separate sub-folders)
* When you are finished with the assignment, push your git repository to GitHub so that the GitHub version of your repository is up to date. There should be four PNG files and four R code files, a total of eight files in the top-level folder of the repo.

The four plots that you will need to construct are
